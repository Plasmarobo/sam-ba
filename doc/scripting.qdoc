\title SAM-BA Scripting Documentation
\brief This document contains information on writing SAM-BA scripts.

\section1 Scripting SAM-BA

SAM-BA uses Qt5 QML language for scripting.

\section2 Running a SAM-BA script

SAM-BA scripts are QML scripts and can be loaded using the \tt sam-ba command-line tool.

For example, to run 'my-script.qml', the following command line is used:
\tt{sam-ba -x my-script.qml}

\section2 Initial QML script

This minimal QML script shows how to react to script loading and unloading.
This mechanism is used by all the SAM-BA scripts:

\qml
import QtQuick 2.3

Item {
	Component.onCompleted: print("Script started")
	Component.onDestruction: print("Script completed")
}
\endqml

This example uses QML signals to react to events: when the script is loaded,
the message "Script started" is displayed. When the script is unloaded, the
message "Script completed" is displayed.

\section2 Connecting to a device

To connect to a device, an instance of \l{SAMBA::}{Connection} must be used.
The \l{SAMBA::}{Connection} type contains methods to read/write memory on the
device and make it execute code.

In this example, a SerialConnection is used:
\qml
import SAMBA 3.2
import SAMBA.Connection.Serial 3.2

SerialConnection {
	onConnectionOpened: print("Connection opened")
	onConnectionFailed: print("Connection failed: " + message)
	onConnectionClosed: print("Connection closed")
}
\endqml

This script instanciates a serial connection with its default properties.  In
particular, the \tt autoConnect property that defaults to \tt true will trigger
an automatic connection once the QML object is created.

This will in turn trigger one of the \tt onConnectionOpened or \tt
onConnectionFailed signals and display a message.

When the script completes, the connection will be automatically closed.  This
will trigger the \tt onConnectionClosed signal and display a final message.

\section2 Using SAM-BA Applets

The \l{SAMBA::}{Connection} object provides several functions to load applets
and make tha currently loaded applet to execute commands.

The applet must first be loaded using the initializeApplet function.  This
function will upload the applet code to the device, call the initialization
function and update the \tt applet property of the connection.

In this example, a SerialConnection is used to load the \tt serialflash applet
on a SAMA5D2 Xplained Ultra board and the applet \tt erase function is called:

\qml
import SAMBA 3.2
import SAMBA.Connection.Serial 3.2
import SAMBA.Device.SAMA5D2 3.2

SerialConnection {
	device: SAMA5D2Xplained {}
	onConnectionOpened: {
		initializeApplet("serialflash")
		applet.erase()
	}
}
\endqml

\section2 More QML examples

The \tt examples directory in the SAM-BA distribution contains more
advanced examples.

It is recommended to start by reading and modifying the provided examples, then
to refer to the \l{SAM-BA API Reference} and
\l{http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmlreference.html}{QML Reference}.
